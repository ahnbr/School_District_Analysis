Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis was to look at different factors that led to the subject and overall passing percentage of students from different high schools of different types. This included looking at the types of schools, the school budget and how that budget applied to students on a per/student basis.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

How is the district summary affected?

Total Schools	Total Students	Total Budget	  Average Math Score	Average Reading Score	% Passing Math	% Passing Reading	% Overall Passing
0	    15	    39,170	        $24,649,428.00	78.9	              81.9	                74	            85	              79

In looking at the district summary, while the overall average scores for both math and reading were passing, the actual percent of students that were passing math was well below the mean while the percent of students passing reading was above the average. From this it would appear that perhaps at least regarding the math scores, there is a larger gap between those with passing scores as compared to those with failing scores.

How is the school summary affected?
When looking at the average scores on a per school basis, it was clear that both reading and math scores on average across all grade levels were relatively consistent although the reading scores were consistently higher.

How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
By removing the 9th grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School, I believe it lowered Thomas High School's overall performance because the 9th grade math and reading scores helped Thomas High School rate better overall.

How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Because the 9th graders seemed to genereally score well, by replacing their scores with NaN, it will have put more of an onus on grades 10-12 without the help of an additional set of numbers that would otherwise have increased the school's overall performance.

Scores by school spending
If we remove the 9th graders as somewhat of an outlier in performance, it would then mean that the cost per student on the return they were getting would be higher than the result that the school was receiving in comparison to other schools.

Scores by school size
Similarly to school spending, removing the class would also indicate that based on the size of the school, it would appear that Thomas High School was performing at a level that would be considered less efficient than other schools of the same size.

Scores by school type
        Average Math Score	Average Reading Score	% Passing Math	% Passing Reading	% Overall Passing
Schooltype				
Charter	  83.5	              83.9	                90	          93	              92
District	77.0	              81.0	                67	          81	              74

This would show that the expectation of what Thomas High School should be doing versus how they are performing would be two-fold. First that they would be bringing down the average scores for Charter schools but also that they are underperforming the expected mean for how Charter schools should be performing.

Summary: Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
The four major changes would be that the subject and overall pass rate for Thomas High School when removing 9th grade students went down.
Secondly, it indicates that for the amount of money based on the budget the school spends on per student would appear to to be below the expectations for a school with a budget of that size.
Thirdly, for a school based on the student population, removing the 9th grader's scores showed that Thomas High School would also be considered to be underperforming when compared to other schools of similar size.
Lastly, for a school type, as seen above, the overall pass rate is very high at 92% whereas Thomas High School is lower at 80.9%. This would show that among Charter schools, Thomas High School has a relatively significant drop off in overall pass rate when considering the expected pass rate for Charter schools.
